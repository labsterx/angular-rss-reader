angular-rss-reader
==================

This is a RSS reader web app implemented with AngularJS.

This web app is developed using a test-driven development (TDD) approach. The repository includes both unit-tests and E2E tests. For unit testing, I used Karma, Mocha, Chai and Sinon etc. For end-to-end (E2E) tests, I used Protractor, Mocha, Chai and Sinon etc.

I used Gulp as the build system for this project.
